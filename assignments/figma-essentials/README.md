# Figma Essentials

## Introduction
The task for this assignment is to create a simple responsive hero section in Figma. The hero section will include a menu. Make menu items a Figma component. Use auto-layout, auto-spacing, constraints features. We didn't just make hero section, we also made whole home page design.

P.S. We are new to Figma, so we tried to do our best. Also we made 20 seconds video instead of max 15, we couldn't make it shorter.

We hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š
