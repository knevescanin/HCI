# User personas and information architecture

## Introduction

The task for this assignment is to create user personas and develop an information architecture for a specific project. User personas are fictional characters created to represent the different user types that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way. Information architecture is the structural design of shared information environments, such as websites and software applications, to support usability and findability. Sitemaps are used to visualize the structure and hierarchy of information on a website.

We've created a set of 3 user personas relevant to our project. We've also developed an information architecture based on the card sorting method and created a sitemap for our web application. ChatGPT prompts are also included.

We hope you like it! üòä (ChatGPT and Copilot say hi!!!)

## Personas

Create a set of user personas (3) relevant to a this project. These personas should represent the target audience for the web page. Include variety of demographic details, personality traits, and context-specific information.
